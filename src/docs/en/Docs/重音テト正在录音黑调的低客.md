## Humor Analysis
- ### 低调的黑客
  [00:00] [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JgkiB6E8Y?t=0s) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHdmyWYnI6o?t=0s)
  The term "低调的黑客" (Dīdiào de Hēikè - The Low-Key Hacker) comes from a new meme that emerged around October 2025. These memes usually start with "Do you know how terrifying an angry hacker is?" and are typically paired with some nonsensical, irrelevant video footage.

- ### 低客的黑调
  [00:11] [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JgkiB6E8Y?t=11s) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHdmyWYnI6o?t=11s)<br>
  It's a rearrangement of "[低调的黑客](#parse1)" into "低客的黑调" (Dī kè de hēi diào). Its [Hanyu Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) is "Dī kè de hēi diào," which simultaneously acts as a Reverse Mondegreen Pun for "dick's 黑屌" (hēi diǎo - black penis).
- ### 看完blue的是这个
  [00:16] [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JgkiB6E8Y?t=16s) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHdmyWYnI6o?t=16s)<br>
  "blue" is a Reverse Mondegreen for "不撸" (bù lǔ). The actual meaning of the phrase is "The one who doesn't '撸' (lǔ) after watching is this," where "撸" refers to male masturbation.
- ### 注意图中没有领带
  [00:19] [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JgkiB6E8Y?t=19s) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHdmyWYnI6o?t=19s)<br>
  The tie (领带) is visually associated with the male reproductive organ (phallus).

- ### 注意黑客不一定是低调，而黑调一定是低客
  [00:23] [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JgkiB6E8Y?t=23s) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHdmyWYnI6o?t=23s)<br>
  The first half of the sentence sets up the appearance of the second half. "而黑调一定是低客" (And 黑调 must be 低客) is a Reverse Mondegreen for "而黑屌一定是dick" (And black penis must be a dick).
- ### 你现在一定在看b站，你一定看到了这视频，你一定看到了tietou
  [00:30] [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JgkiB6E8Y?t=30s) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHdmyWYnI6o?t=30s)<br>
  1. "b站" is the common Chinese abbreviation for the video platform [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com). The source video is on BiliBili.<br>
  2. "tietou" is the phonetic transcription of "Teto" from "[重音teto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasane_Teto)" (Kasane Teto).<br>
     Therefore, this sentence is an example of [Wastewater Literature (废话文学)] (stating the obvious).
- ### 91-78=13
  [00:36] [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JgkiB6E8Y?t=36s) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHdmyWYnI6o?t=36s)<br>
  1. "91" here refers to "91传媒/91制片厂," organizations that produce explicit videos/content.<br>
  2. "78" is a Homophonic Pun for "鸡巴" (jība - penis).<br>
  3. "13" here is visually similar to "B," which is a Homophonic Pun for "逼" (bī - female genitalia).<br>
- ### 青春伤痛一定是遗憾，低调的黑客看过魔丸
  [00:36] [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JgkiB6E8Y?t=36s) [YouTube](https://youtu.be/sHdmyWYnI6o?t=36s)<br>
  1. "青春伤痛一定是遗憾" (Youth pain must be regret) ostensibly talks about regret but implicitly suggests that youth pain might stem from sexual experiences.<br>
  2. "低调的黑客" is meaningless here. "魔丸" (Mówán - Demon Pill/Orb) is a popular nickname for the protagonist "[哪吒](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nezha)" (Nezha) in the Chinese film *[哪吒之魔童闹海](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_Zha_(2019_film))*. (Note: Linked to the 2019 film based on the context, as that is the common "Mó Wán" reference).<br>

It's a popular meme that originated on English-speaking internet forums and social media (like Reddit, Tumblr, etc.), often used as a playful, sarcastic, or mocking commentary on identity politics and non-binary gender identities.

      "哈基米南北绿豆" (Hajimīnán Běi lǜ dòu) is a Mondegreen for the Japanese phrase "はちみつなめると" (hachimitsu nameru to, meaning "If you lick honey...").
      "はちみつ" (Hachimitsu - Honey) is from the scene in [Umamusume Pretty Derby Season 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby) around 10 minutes and 20 seconds of episode 12, where the character [Tokai Teio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby) hums it while going to buy a honey drink.
      The phrase "なめると" (Nameru to) is transcribed as "南北绿豆" (Nán běi lǜ dòu - South North Mung Bean) because "哈基米南北绿豆" has recently been frequently used by creators to fill lyrics for various songs.
